I would choose to use an SQLite Database. As a lightweight and serverless database, SQLite is proposed for storing user data, location information, and other relevant data points. This could be good for the limited information that you input through the website. The database scheme could have a place for users that stores user information such as username, email, and hashed passwords. It could also track user interactions with the website, such as searches, clicks, and preferences. I would use /home (GET), /login (POST), and /search (POST). The functionality is user authentication where the login and register routes enable users to create accounts and log in securely, enhancing website security. We also have user profiles where the profile route enables users to view and manage their profile information, enhancing the overall user experience.
